        <li>Detect and highlight connective tissue</li>
        <li>Detect and highlight nerves</li>
        <li>Detect and highlight pancreas</li>
        <li>Detect and highlight blood vessels</li>
        <li>
            Provide guidance on location of blood vessels early during surgery and by this help to reduce unintentional injury of blood vessels and related complications
        </li>
        <li>Detect and highlight ureter</li>
        <li>
            Automatic recording of bleeding scenes that meet certain pre-defined conditions for post-surgery
        </li>
        <li>
            Help by raising awareness for a natural tissue plain to follow during dissection which is usually avascular and aneural. This can help to avoid unintentional injury to critical structures.
        </li>
        <li>Customization of transparency level of overlays</li>
        <li>
            Provide guidance on location of nerves early during surgery and by this help to reduce unintentional injury of nerves and related complications
        </li>
        <li>Detect and highlight vas deferens</li>
        <li>
            Provide guidance on location of vas deferens early during surgery and by this help to reduce unintentional injury of vas deferens and related complications
        </li>
        <li>Customization of persistency of overlays</li>
        <li>
            Help to identify the pancreas and to differentiate the pancreas from fatty tissue to help avoid unintentional injuries to the pancreas
        </li>
        <li>
            Provide guidance on location of ureters early during surgery and by this help to reduce unintentional injury of ureters and related complications
        </li>
        <li>
            Automatic detection and recording of clips of bleeding at a specified volume threshold, to review either intra- or post-operatively to identify source and cause of bleeding
        </li>
        <li>
            Transparency level of overlays can be manually adjusted by the user
        </li>
        <li>
            Overlays can be shown at time intervals (e.g., show every 3 seconds)
